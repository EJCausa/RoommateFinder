TO-DO DURING NEXT MEETING:

-CREATE A SKELETAL DBOPS.JAVA FILE (CLASS DECLARATION AND COMMENTS LISTING FURTHER TO-DOS SHOULD BE ENOUGH)

-CREATE ADDITIONAL SKELETAL HANDLERS AS NEEDED?

-REVIEW CLASS DIAGRAM

-CHECK IF ANY COMMENTS OUTSTANDING FROM LAST DELIVERABLE

The only things in the Controller class right now are UI strings and methods to print them. Maybe we should rename Controller.java to UI.java?
