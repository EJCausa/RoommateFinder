# RoommateFinder

TO-DO DURING NEXT MEETING:

-CREATE A SKELETAL DBOPS.JAVA FILE (CLASS DECLARATION AND COMMENTS LISTING FURTHER TO-DOS SHOULD BE ENOUGH)

-CREATE ADDITIONAL SKELETAL HANDLERS AS NEEDED?

-REVIEW CLASS DIAGRAM

-CHECK IF ANY COMMENTS OUTSTANDING FROM LAST DELIVERABLE

The only things in the UserInterface class right now are UserInterface strings and methods to print them. Maybe we
should rename
UserInterface.java to UserInterface.java?
